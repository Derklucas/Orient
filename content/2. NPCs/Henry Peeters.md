The conducteur on the Constantinople car is Henri Peeters, a rail-thin dark haired Belgian in an impeccable uniform. Henri is very friendly and will help the investigators. His greeting is always: “Henri is here. How may I help you?” He is thoroughly unflappable in the best Wagons-Lits style. Henri has already taken a dislike to [[Hieronymus Menkaph |Menkaph]] when he boarded in Paris, because the man is uncouth and taking inappropriate interest in [[Elizabeth 'Ellie' Myers |Mrs. Myers]] while her husband is clearly sick. He will, for a tastefully offered gratuity, offer some service even beyond the norm.
