Professor Julius Arthur Smith, Litt.D., Ph.D., is 59, a heavy-set Englishman, a scholar who now devotes himself entirely to research. He is famed for his whiskers and great curling moustaches that give him the air of a friendly walrus. His disgusting preferences in tobaccos (especially his favorite, a foul, obsidian-hued Balkan Sobranje), his erudite after-dinner stories, and his hearty laugh are trademarks.

Dr. Smith has lived and traveled extensively on the Continent, His specialties are European languages and archaeology; his Litt.D. was conferred by the University of Vienna. In the past, he has aided you in rendering difficult translations. Now his attention has shifted to matters parapsychological, with excellent result.

The professor maintains a town house in St. Johnâ€™s Wood, where he resides when in London.
