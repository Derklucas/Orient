Macgregor is a Christian suffragette and reporter for the *Woman’s Herald*.
She is interested in international issues and is independently wealthy, and thus funding a fact finding mission to the Ottoman Empire. The British (and later the Americans) are especially intrigued with the ‘Armenian Question’ in the Ottoman Empire, especially the fate of Armenians as Christians within a Muslim Empire. Aileen is also interested in the lot of women there. Armenian nationalists are agitating to break away from the Empire and political, religious, and ethnic tensions are high. There have been armed clashes between Armenians and their Muslim neighbors. This will soon erupt in bloodshed and massacre, but for the time being things are merely simmering with the odd outbreak of violence and rumors of rebellion. Aileen intends to go to the Ottoman court to find answers to their approach, then to travel in Armenia. Macgregor is an intense but pleasant woman and comes from a well off Lowlands family, hence her capacity to travel on the Orient Express. She is keen to get to her story fast.
