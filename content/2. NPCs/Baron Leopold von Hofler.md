The Baron is mysterious. He is a noted occultist but also a wealthy and powerful man in his native Austria, being part of the Austrian nobility. He does not publish but is known for raeadily helping those who are interested in the area of the occult, including hosting them at his estate outside of Vienna and giving access to his private library. He also has a reputation for generosity, and often underwrites the activities of other scholars through his vast wealth.

The Baron is respected for his knowledge and determination but is known to be a difficult person who does not suffer fools. There is also a suggestion that he has let his personal magnetism and trappings of power go too far. Something close to a cult is currently forming around him. Despite this, no-one has accused the Baron of anything outwardly wrong.

He is a friend of [[Dr. Julius Smith]]
