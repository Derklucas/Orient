Elizabeth and [[Scott Myers |her new husband]] were preparing a honeymoon in Paris, and then on the Orient Express to Constantinople, when her husband fell under the spell of Menkaph and was persuaded to wear the Fez. He is now in a coma. Elizabeth is living a nightmare, watching him slip away, hearing the terrible whispering of the Fez right at her ear in the small compartment, as she travels further away from her loved ones in the company of terrible people who are prepared to sacrific her husband. She spends most of the time in tears and is shepherded by [[Hieronymus Menkaph |Menkaph]]
