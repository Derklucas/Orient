It is close to midnight on May 15th, 1893. The night is warm, but the air is thick with fog, obscuring the narrow streets of London. Inside his modest study, [[Captain Lewis Pinkerton]] sits in a worn leather chair, a pipe smoldering between his fingers as he peruses a book on 17th-century warfare. The silence of the night is broken by a sharp knock at the door. He gestures for his butler, Alfred, who soon returns with a message: a young man stands at the entrance, bearing a note.  
  
At the same time, in a dimly lit hotel room across the city, Dr. [[Nathaniel Stahr]] sits at his desk, scribbling in his journal. The soft glow of the gas lamp barely cuts through the fog pressing against the window. A knock echoes from his door, and he opens it to find a boy with a similar note.  
  
Meanwhile, in the bustling streets, [[Francis Butcher]], lurking in the shadows for an easy mark, feels a tug on his sleeve. A young lad hands him the same message.  
  
Each note bears the familiar hand of [[Dr. Julius Smith |Professor Julius Smith]], summoning them to an address in Whitechapel and urging them to bring a gun.  
  
Captain Pinkerton orders Alfred to prepare the coach. Nathaniel hails a cab, and Francis, with no money, steals an old bicycle and makes his way toward the dark heart of Whitechapel.  
  
As the three investigators arrive at the address in Whitechapel, Professor Julius Smith stands outside, waiting impatiently. The fog swirls around them, and shadows loom in the mist—ordinary people, at first glance, moving about their business. Yet, in the distance, a figure wearing a fez watches them intently. When they blink, the man is gone.  
  
Without a word, Smith gestures for them to follow. They enter the dimly lit building, where Smith hands a few coins to the elderly landlady, whispering something too soft for them to catch. The atmosphere is tense as they ascend the narrow stairs, the air growing heavier with each step.  
  
At the top, they find a small, almost entirely blackened room. Two flickering candles cast weak light over a frail man lying in bed, his condition poor and unsettling. His head is crowned by a fez, unnervingly attached as if fused to his skin. Another figure, Dr. Nils Hobbs, stands nearby. Despite his expertise with the police, his investigations into the man’s ailment have uncovered nothing.  
  
Professor Smith begins his explanation, his voice low and urgent. Four days prior, a well-dressed man named [[Hieronymus Menkaph |Mr. Leeds]] rented this very room from Mrs. Grim, the elderly landlady. He paid her a considerable sum—more than enough to keep her from asking too many questions. Shortly after, men wearing fezzes brought a semi-conscious body into the room, locking the door behind them. Only those strange men were seen coming and going.  
  
By the second night, the other tenants began complaining of strange noises—scratching, murmurs in the dark. By the third night, the sounds escalated to shrieks and heavy thumping, disturbing even the most hardened residents. When questioned, Mr. Leeds claimed they were treating his drug-addicted brother. But tonight, the fourth night, the sounds had become ungodly, impossible to ignore. In desperation, Mrs. Grim called the police.  
  
When they arrived, Mr. Leeds and the men in fezzes had already vanished, leaving the poor soul in the bed. When the police checked him, the man whispered Professor Smith’s name before losing consciousness. Smith suspects the man, who now appears as an elderly shell, is much younger than he looks.  
  
The group discusses how to move the body without touching it, but suddenly the figure begins to tremble violently, letting out a horrifying death rattle. As Dr. Hobbs moves to inspect him, the candles flicker and die. In the darkness, the body lunges up and bites into Dr. Hobbs' face. Hobbs faints instantly, collapsing as the room descends into chaos  
  
Professor Smith bolts down the stairs, calling out frantically to Mrs. Grim, desperate to get her to safety. Meanwhile, Francis Butcher lunges at the monstrous figure, aiming to bring it down. But the creature strikes him with unnatural force, sending him stumbling backward. Nathaniel Stahr, seeing the chaos unfold, slips quietly into an adjacent room, gathering his nerves to prepare an attack.  
  
Captain Lewis Pinkerton, ever the soldier, keeps his head steady. Drawing his army revolver, he steps forward and, from close range, fires a single, precise shot. The bullet tears into the creature’s skull, scattering bone and brain matter. The beast crumples to the floor in a lifeless heap.  
  
“Destroy the fez!” shouts Professor Smith as he rushes back into the room, his voice filled with urgency.  
  
Nathaniel, thinking quickly, attempts to set the cursed object ablaze. But as soon as the flames touch it, they sputter out, as if the fez itself rejects the fire. Francis, undeterred by the earlier blow, grabs the fez with bare hands. Instantly, a wave of nausea and sickness overwhelms him. He staggers, his face pale, yet forces himself to plunge a dagger into the cursed headwear. But to his horror, the fez resists—its fibers writhing, reknitting themselves as though alive, unyielding to any mortal attempt to destroy it.  
  
Nathaniel swiftly administers first aid to the unconscious Dr. Hobbs, stabilizing him after the creature’s attack. A plan is quickly made: Nathaniel and Captain Lewis Pinkerton will take Dr. Hobbs to the hospital, and Nathaniel will stay the night at Lewis’s house. Meanwhile, Francis is tasked with bringing the cursed fez to Professor Smith’s residence and staying there.  
  
That night, Lewis and Nathaniel have a quiet, uneventful evening, though the strange events linger in their minds. Francis, however, is tormented by nightmares—visions of men in fezzes and dark, faceless shadows. The fez seems to exude a sinister energy, unsettling him throughout the night.  
  
By morning, Professor Smith is mysteriously absent, but as planned, the three men meet at noon at [[the Oriental Club]], carrying the weight of their eerie experiences.  
  
At the Oriental Club, Professor Smith briefs the group on his recent communication with [[Professor Demir |Professor Adnan Demir]] in Constantinople. Smith reveals that the body they encountered is that of [[Matthew Pook]], a student of Demir. Pook had been investigating a cult leader named [[Menkaph]] and had stolen a dangerous artifact known as the Blood Red Fez of Menkaph. According to Demir, this fez must be taken to Constantinople and destroyed to prevent further harm.  
  
Smith explains that the fastest route is the Orient Express, which will get them to Constantinople in three days. However, the journey is costly. To cover the expenses, Smith has enlisted the aid of [[Baron Leopold von Hofler]], a wealthy Austrian noble and noted occultist known for combating evil forces. The Baron has agreed to pay for their tickets and join them on the train, believing his expertise will be valuable.  
  
They have secured tickets for Wednesday, which is just two days away, and preparations are underway for their urgent departure.  
  
A plan is devised to acquire three additional fezzes as decoys to mislead the men in fezzes, ensuring they cannot easily identify the real Blood Red Fez. Professor Smith, however, informs them that he cannot accompany them to Constantinople due to a past conflict with a cult leader named [[Selim Makryat]], which would spell his doom should he venture east.  
  
Until their departure to Dover, Sir Lewis Pinkerton delves into the Oriental Club’s extensive library, searching for information on the fez. His efforts yield nothing, and he suffers a minor injury when he falls down the stairs. He also inquires about Baron von Hofler among the club’s members and hears only favorable remarks about the Baron.  
  
Meanwhile, Francis and Nathaniel return to the Whitechapel house. On the way, Nathaniel reads an old newspaper article about a fez collector who was murdered in Rotherhithe. At the house, Mrs. Grim provides a description of Mr. Leeds—handsome with a British accent. They find some hastily translated documents, ticket stubs for the Princes Isles in Constantinople, and an address in Shoreditch.  
  
Deciding to unwind, they head back to the Oriental Club for gin, cigars, and dinner, preparing for their imminent journey.  
  
The following day, Francis and Nathaniel head to the address in Shoreditch. Francis attempts to break in, but the noise attracts the attention of a man who flees the scene. Lewis manages to catch up and persuades him to return for a discussion. They reconvene in a nearby pub, where Lewis promises to cover the cost of repairing the door that Nathaniel kicked in.  
  
The man introduces himself as [[Bentley Burnham]], a journalist planning a trip to Constantinople to cover the new sultan's trade route openings. He reveals that he had hoped to meet Matthew Pook for advice but never succeeded. Lewis agrees to pay Burnham to research the fezzes and telegraph any findings while they’re on the train.  
  
Next, the group visits the address in Rotherhithe. A lone constable, recognizing Lewis, allows them access to the crime scene under the condition that they do not touch anything. They discover that the only item stolen was a book titled [[The Whispering Fez]]. A letter from Mr. Leeds indicates he offered 100 pounds for it, but a ledger shows only 25 pounds was paid. Lewis discreetly smuggles the ledger out.  
  
With their preparations complete, all that remains is the journey aboard the Orient Express.
