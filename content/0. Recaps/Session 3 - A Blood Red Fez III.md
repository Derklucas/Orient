[[Session 2 - A Blood Red Fez II |<Previous Session]]

The Orient Express pulls into Vienna Westbahnhof, its iron frame gleaming as steam billows into the crisp morning air. [[Captain Lewis Pinkerton |Pinkerton]] and [[Nathaniel Stahr |Stahr]], weary yet alert, scan the crowd on the platform. There, striding toward them, is [[Francis Butcher]]—sent ahead by [[Dr. Julius Smith |Professor Smith]]. Beside him stand two unfamiliar figures. Butcher greets them, “Glad you made it. Professor Smith thought it best I introduce you to [[Baron Leopold von Hofler |Baron von Hofler]] and his associate [[Enzo Marconi]], here to assist in your… investigation.”  
  
Baron von Hofler, a tall, dignified figure with striking silver hair and a tailored coat, acknowledges them with a solemn nod. Marconi, suave and impeccably dressed, follows suit. As they exchange greetings, a [[Ilsa von Hofler |young woman]], her face anxious, approaches the Baron, her hands clasped tightly. “Bitte, Vati, don’t go. You know what happened last time,” she implores in German, a soft tremor in her voice.  
  
The Baron places a gentle hand on her shoulder. “I must, meine Tochter,” he murmurs. After a lingering embrace, she steps back, watching as her father boards the train, her eyes wet with worry.  
  
Once aboard, as the train glides out of Vienna, Baron von Hofler wastes no time in examining the ancient, blood-red fez and the strange book Stahr and Pinkerton brought. His keen gaze is alight with scholarly curiosity as he inspects the items. “Have you attempted any… tests on it yet?” he asks, his tone half-excited, half-cautious.  
  
The men exchange wary glances. “No, we’ve kept it at a distance,” replies Pinkerton.  
  
The Baron frowns, mumbling, “Naturwissenschaft und occultism—science and the occult—they demand das Experimentieren.” With unsettling speed, he seizes the fez and, before Stahr can stop him, places it squarely on Stahr’s head.  
  
“Baron, no!” Pinkerton shouts, but it’s too late. Stahr feels an odd warmth as the fez settles onto his scalp, and when he reaches to pull it off, his fingers meet resistance. It feels as if the fabric has melded to his skin. Panic wells up within him.  
  
“It's… stuck,” he says, his voice strained. His pulse races as he struggles to remove it, and his head begins to ache with a faint, insistent pressure.  
  
The Baron’s excitement fades as he observes the struggle. “This is fascinating,” he says with a hint of trepidation. “These fezzes, they’re said to grant control over those who wear them… perhaps at a cost.”  
  
“Baron,” Pinkerton warns, “we need to get it off. Now.” But Stahr can feel the hat’s grip, tight and unnatural, as if it has its own mind. Only with Marconi’s assistance does he manage to pry it free, leaving a red, irritated ring on his scalp.  
  
As dusk falls, the Orient Express glides through the countryside, fields and villages blurring in the fading light. Their destination is Budapest, but a renewed sense of unease hangs over the group. They agree it’s time to confront Menkaph, whose presence and influence seem to pervade the train with each passing mile.  
  
In the lounge car, Pinkerton spots [[Hieronymus Menkaph]] and approaches with a steady gaze, claiming, “Your servant has taken my wallet.” Menkaph’s face darkens; he turns and heads toward his private cabin, with Pinkerton, Stahr, and Butcher following closely.  
  
[[Henry Peeters]], the train’s conductor, arrives at the scene and, upon Pinkerton’s insistence, knocks sharply on Menkaph’s door, demanding it be opened. The door swings open, revealing Menkaph and his silent servant, [[Kapok]]. Menkaph meets Stahr’s gaze in a strange, charged moment. For an instant, time seems to halt, and Stahr feels a disorienting pull as Menkaph’s dark eyes bore into his.  
  
Menacing but calm, Menkaph breaks the silence. “Captain Pinkerton, your accusations are unfounded.” He smirks as Pinkerton, to his own embarrassment, finds his wallet in his pocket. Peeters, visibly unimpressed, urges the group to disperse, but as they leave, Menkaph’s eyes linger on them, his expression unreadable.  
  
Later, as midnight deepens and the train clatters softly along the tracks, Francis Butcher sneaks out of his cabin. The quiet hallways draw him forward in his exploration, but his curiosity quickly shifts to fear when a shadowy, translucent figure materializes from the dimness ahead. It glides toward him, claws slashing through the air. Butcher stumbles back, clutching his side as blood stains his coat, and he scrambles to escape. Just then, a door swings open, casting a rectangle of warm light into the corridor.  
  
[[Countess Irina Razumoska |The Countess]] stands in her doorway, her gaze curious yet sharp. “What’s going on, Mr. Butcher?”  
  
Butcher, breathless and pale, steadies himself and asks, “Might I borrow a lantern, Countess?” She nods, and as she hands it to him, he glances into her compartment, spotting a man inside. Choosing not to ask questions, he hurries back to his room, the shadow retreating into the darkness, apparently held at bay by the lantern’s glow.  
  
The next morning, the dining car hums with murmurs as passengers gather for breakfast, but two notable absences do not go unnoticed. Baron von Hofler is missing, and the exotic woman Marconi had been conversing with has also vanished. Pinkerton, Stahr, and Butcher exchange uneasy glances before enlisting Peeters to assist them in inspecting the Baron’s compartment.  
  
After knocking with no answer, Peeters unlocks the door, revealing a ransacked room. Sheets are tossed aside, and drawers stand open. Dr. Stahr, inspecting closely, discovers a hypodermic needle on the floor, the faint smell of laudanum lingering. “Something happened here,” he murmurs, his voice laced with concern.  
  
As they contemplate the mystery, Butcher feels something in his coat pocket. He unfolds a note: “Mister, I need your help. Please meet me around 1 p.m. in the lounge. Countessa Irina.”  
  
At precisely 1 p.m., Francis waits in the lounge, and Countessa Irina enters, gliding to a seat in the far corner. She motions for him to sit behind her rather than across. Speaking quietly, she confides in him about an affair with Pytor, her husband’s cousin, which she wishes to end. However, [[Pytor Trubosky |Pytot]] refuses and has threatened to expose her. She implores Francis to intervene.  
  
Later that evening, Francis finds Pytor alone in a compartment, nursing a drink. When Francis warns him to stay away from the Countessa, Pytor’s expression hardens, and he sneers, “Keep to your own business, Butcher.” His cold, defiant eyes make it clear he will not be intimidated.  
  
The train barrels eastward through the night, its passengers growing increasingly tense. As the journey continues, Stahr begins to look pale, his features drawn, his eyes hollow. Shadows seem to darken beneath his eyes, as though some unseen force is draining him from within.  
  
As they near the borders of Hungary, Stahr shares a quiet breakfast with Pinkerton, his energy visibly waning. “This… fez,” he murmurs, “it’s done something to me. I can feel it.”  
  
Butcher, deeply concerned, listens as Pinkerton recounts their findings in the ancient Persian book they discovered alongside the fez. The text, titled The Whispering Fez, speaks of rituals, strange names—like Yog-Sothoth—and even instructions for creating multiple fezzes, all connected by some dark magic. Pinkerton suspects the book may hold clues to destroying the fez, though any specific method remains elusive.   
  
That night, as the Orient Express races toward Constantinople, Dr. Stahr’s condition worsens. His hands shake, his skin pale and clammy. He confides in Pinkerton, admitting he’s been hearing whispers—soft, insidious voices that tug at the edges of his mind.  
  
“Something is in my head,” he whispers, fear evident in his eyes.   
  
The dawn breaks over the city’s skyline as the Orient Express finally pulls into Constantinople. Exhausted but resolute, Pinkerton, Stahr, and Butcher prepare to disembark, each carrying the weight of the journey they’ve endured. In the streets of Constantinople, the final pieces of their dark puzzle await, promising answers—and perhaps retribution—at last.
