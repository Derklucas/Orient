[[Session 1 - A Blood Red Fez |< Previous Session]]

At precisely 9:30, [[Nathaniel Stahr]] and [[Captain Lewis Pinkerton]] arrive at Victoria Station. The grand terminal buzzes with the energy of travelers, steam from the engines billowing in the cool morning air. They had received a telegram earlier from [[Francis Butcher]], informing them he would miss the train due to an urgent errand, leaving Stahr, Pinkerton, and Alfred, the Captain's faithful butler, to embark alone. As the station clock strikes 10:00, the train departs with a punctual hiss of steam, gliding out of the city.

As the train weaves through the rolling English countryside, the fog of London gives way to sprawling fields and quiet villages. The landscape is a patchwork of green meadows dotted with grazing sheep and the occasional winding river. Hedgerows and stone cottages blur past as the train speeds southward toward the coast. The gentle rhythm of the wheels on the tracks becomes a steady companion as they draw closer to Dover.

Upon arrival, passengers and their luggage are swiftly transferred to a ferry bound for Calais. The sea is calm, and the crossing, smooth and uneventful. A light breeze carries the scent of saltwater, and the pale sunlight reflects off the gentle waves. Nathaniel Stahr occupies his time on both the train and ferry by studying his Latin with the aid of a dictionary, meticulously brushing up on the ancient language in preparation for whatever they might encounter in Constantinople. Captain Pinkerton, always the disciplined military man, spends his hours similarly, sharpening his knowledge of Pashtu, keeping his mind focused on the tasks ahead.

Upon arriving in Calais, passengers and their luggage are transferred to a train bound for Châlons-sur-Marne. As they settle aboard, Nathaniel catches a glimpse of someone familiar—[[Bentley Burnham]], the journalist they had met in Shoreditch. He informs Pinkerton, who remains behind while Nathaniel searches the train. It doesn’t take long for him to find Bentley.

Bentley explains that he sent a telegram, which would be waiting for them aboard the Orient Express. The message informs them that he can no longer assist with their research. His employer has redirected him to Stuttgart to cover a possible espionage story. He even shows Nathaniel his visa and ticket, confirming his sudden change in plans.

Nathaniel leads Bentley back to Pinkerton, where the journalist repeats the story. After a brief exchange, Bentley departs, leaving the two men to continue their journey.

Later that evening, during a dinner of steak, pommes juliennes, and whiskey in the dining car, Pinkerton grows curious. He asks a waitress if anything strange has occurred aboard the train. She promises to have her colleague look into it, but for now, the only oddity seems to be a farmer who brought five chickens onto the train—a minor curiosity.

At Châlons-sur-Marne, Nathaniel and Pinkerton's luggage is finally transferred onto the famed Orient Express. As they prepare to board, they are greeted by [[Henry Peeters]], a friendly and professional conductor who takes great pride in showing them around the opulent train. The Orient Express exudes grandeur at every turn—polished mahogany walls, gleaming brass fixtures, and plush velvet upholstery fill the corridors. Their first-class double room is a marvel of luxury, with fine woodwork, silk curtains, and soft leather seating. Everything, from the gold-edged mirrors to the intricate detailing on the lamps, reflects the prestige of this legendary train. Awaiting them is the promised telegram from Bentley Burnham, confirming his earlier explanation.

After settling in, they make their way to the saloon car. The space is equally grand, with crystal chandeliers casting a soft, warm glow and an elegant bar stocked with the finest spirits. Inside, they observe a few intriguing characters. At one table, a woman sits writing notes, clearly focused. At another, a group of three men drink and laugh, their conversation loud and boisterous. In a corner, Nathaniel spots Bentley Burnham deep in conversation with a man, guarded by [[Unknown|another, scowling figure]] who remains silent.

While Pinkerton subtly eavesdrops, he distinctly hears their names being dropped, adding a sense of urgency to the situation. Meanwhile, Nathaniel strikes up a conversation with the woman writing notes. She introduces herself as [[Aileen MacGregor]], a Scottish journalist traveling to Constantinople to cover the persecution of Christian Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.

Pinkerton, feeling the weight of the conversation he'd overheard, decides to confront Bentley and the mysterious man. With a confident stride, he approaches their table, prepared to introduce himself. But before he can speak, the man with the mustache fixes him with a cold, knowing gaze.

“Mister Pinkerton, I know exactly who you are,” the man says, his voice calm but laced with menace. “I suggest you turn around and leave, because if you continue to Constantinople, you will die there.”

Taken aback but unfazed, Pinkerton narrows his eyes and asks for the man’s name.

“[[Hieronymus Menkaph]],” the man replies, his lips curling into a sinister smile as he leans forward. “And I give you this warning not just out of politeness but necessity.”

At that moment, Nathaniel joins the conversation, sensing the tension. Menkaph’s piercing gaze shifts to him, and he repeats the threat. “That goes for you as well, Doctor. You are meddling in matters beyond your understanding. Turn back now, while you still can.”

Before either man can respond, Menkaph's eyes flicker with amusement. “You have something that belongs to me,” he says, his voice almost a whisper. “The fez.”

To emphasize his point, Menkaph reaches into his bag and pulls out an identical blood-red fez. With deliberate slowness, he places it on his head, his dark eyes locked on theirs. The air in the saloon car seems to tighten, and for a long moment, the tension is suffocating. Nathaniel and Pinkerton brace themselves, expecting some dreadful transformation—but nothing happens. The fez sits on Menkaph’s head, inert.

Menkaph smirks, sensing their unease. “You see? You don’t understand the power you’re playing with. You are fools to think you can control it.” His voice lowers, dripping with malice. “Hand over the fez, and you might get out of this alive."

Stahr and Pinkerton retreat to their rooms after the unsettling encounter with Menkaph, their minds troubled but exhaustion overtaking them. They fall into a surprisingly easy sleep, only to be woken at 6 a.m. by [[Henry Peeters]], just as they had requested. Groggy but eager to shake off the lingering unease from the night before, they make their way to the saloon car for a light breakfast of coffee and cakes. The air is crisp and quiet as the train glides smoothly toward Stuttgart.

At the station, [[Bentley Burnham]] disembarks, keeping his promise to head to Stuttgart for his assignment. Pinkerton quickly sends a brief telegram to the _Birmingham Post_, informing them he met their journalist and would like to stay in touch.

As Nathaniel discusses his medical work with Peeters, the conductor mentions there’s a sick traveler on the train. It’s Mr. [[Scott Myers]], a newlywed whose compartment is in the same first-class sleeping car. Peeters offers to show them to Myers' room. As they approach, Nathaniel’s pulse quickens. The door to the adjacent compartment is open, and standing in the doorway is the same silent, menacing man from the night before. His dark, expressionless eyes track their movements but he says nothing. The tension between them is palpable, and Nathaniel feels an instinctual chill, his breath hitching as they pass.

Nathaniel knocks softly on the door to Scott Myers' room. After a moment, it creaks open, revealing a young woman, barely more than a girl, with tear-streaked cheeks. Her eyes are red from weeping, and she hesitates before letting only Nathaniel inside. Mrs. [[Ellie Myers]], the new bride, stammers an apology, her voice trembling as she explains her husband’s condition.

Inside, Scott Myers lies on the bed, pale and motionless, his skin slick with sweat. Nathaniel’s breath catches in his throat when he sees it—a blood-red fez, identical to the one Menkaph taunted them with, is stuck firmly on Scott’s head. Nathaniel's pulse quickens; dread coils in his stomach.

Through quiet sobs, Ellie explains, “We met Mr. Menkaph in Paris. We’re on our honeymoon… Scott was so fascinated by his stories about Constantinople, about those cursed fezzes.” Her voice cracks. “Menkaph… he gave Scott one as a wedding gift. But when Scott put it on, it was too small. It… it just stuck there. He tried to take it off, but it wouldn’t budge.”

Nathaniel leans closer to Scott, the unnatural stillness of the man disturbing. “How long has he been like this?” Nathaniel asks, his voice low, trying not to alarm the already terrified Ellie.

“Since yesterday,” she weeps. “He fell sick not long after… and now he doesn’t respond to anything. I’ve been crying and praying, but nothing helps. And Mr. Menkaph, he…” Ellie’s voice drops, her words barely above a whisper. “He’s been taking care of me. He says he feels responsible."

As Nathaniel approaches Scott Myers, the dim light of the compartment flickers, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The oppressive silence fills the room, broken only by Ellie’s soft, fearful breaths. Nathaniel’s sharp eyes catch a glimpse of something unusual beneath the pillow—a rectangular imprint, barely noticeable but unmistakably there. His pulse quickens. With a steady hand, he asks Ellie to gently prop up her husband.

Ellie, trembling, complies, lifting Scott’s limp body just enough. Nathaniel slips his hand beneath the pillow and pulls out a book. His heart races as he takes in its appearance—the cover is bound in the same blood-red color as the fez on Scott’s head. The book’s spine is worn, its pages yellowed with age. Strange hieroglyphs, identical to those embroidered on the cursed fez, mark the cover, swirling in arcane patterns. The language, Persian, is unfamiliar to Nathaniel, but the symbols are unmistakably dark.

Ellie’s eyes widen in disbelief. "I’ve never seen that before," she whispers, her voice barely audible over the pounding in Nathaniel's ears. The book feels heavy in his hands, as though it holds something ancient, something malevolent.

Nathaniel quickly tucks the book under his arm. “We need to leave,” he says, his voice low and urgent. Without another word, he and Pinkerton slip out of the compartment, the weight of the book like a curse hanging between them.

The tension follows them as they head to their room, where they hastily hide the book. But the morning brings no relief. When they enter the dining car for breakfast, a chill runs down Nathaniel’s spine. There, seated at a table, is Menkaph. Beside him is the [[Unknown|silent servant]]—and Mrs. Myers. And perched on Menkaph’s head, as if mocking them, is the same red fez.

Pinkerton’s blood boils. His jaw clenches as he storms over to the table. “Menkaph,” he growls, “we need to talk.” But Menkaph only looks up with a faint, condescending smile.

“Mister Pinkerton,” Menkaph says coolly, his tone dripping with disdain. “You are wasting your breath.”

Ignoring the dismissive brush-off, Pinkerton leans closer. “What are you doing with her?” His eyes dart to Mrs. Myers, who sits beside Menkaph, her face pale, her eyes hollow.

Menkaph’s servant shifts in his chair, but Menkaph merely raises a hand. “Peeters,” Menkaph calls calmly, turning to the conductor. “Please escort Mister Pinkerton away from my table.”

Peeters, ever professional, steps forward. “Sir, I must ask you to return to your seat,” he says softly, his voice betraying his unease. Pinkerton hesitates, glaring at Menkaph, but eventually steps back, his frustration palpable.

Reluctantly, Pinkerton joins Nathaniel and [[Aileen MacGregor]] at another table. Aileen glances between the men, her brow furrowed with concern. “I heard something strange last night,” she says in a low voice. “A wailing. It came from the front of the train, like someone—or something—was crying out in pain.” The words hang in the air, the tension growing as they wonder what other horrors might be lurking.

As breakfast winds down, one of the foreign travelers rises and approaches their table. He introduces himself with a regal air. “[[Count Rudolph Razumosky]],” he says, his accent thick and commanding. [[Countess Irina Razumoska |His younger wife]] stands by his side, along with his cousin [[Pytor Trubosky]], a broad-shouldered man with a serious expression. “We are traveling to Constantinople, like yourselves.”

Razumosky glances toward Menkaph’s table and adds, “My servant shares quarters with his man. Odd fellow, that one. Doesn’t speak a word.”

Nathaniel and Pinkerton exchange uneasy glances, the strange web around them tightening.

Just past Munich, a telegram arrives for Pinkerton. He rips it open, expecting news from Burnham. But his eyes widen as he reads the message: _According to the Birmingham Post, no Bentley Burnham works for us._ A cold dread grips him. They’ve been deceived. But by whom? And why?

Later in the day, Pinkerton retreats to their room with the book they found under Scott Myers’ pillow. The title sends a shiver down his spine: _[[The Whispering Fez]]_. As he pores over its ancient, cryptic text, he pieces together fragments of rituals—dark ceremonies involving the fez and its terrible power. His heart races as he reads the name, _Yog-Sothoth_, scrawled in faded ink. The book hints at a terrifying truth: the wearer of the fez can control others who bear it. Worse still, the fez can be replicated, spreading its curse.

But there is hope. Buried deep in the text, Pinkerton suspects there may be a way to destroy it—a ritual, perhaps, but the details are unclear. He grips the book tightly as the train pulls into Vienna Westbahnhof, a sense of urgency flooding through him. Time is running out, and Menkaph is already one step ahead
